The provided C++ program is a simple budget tracking application that allows users to input financial transactions, categorizing them as either income or expenses. The program defines two classes: `Transaction` and `BudgetTracker`.The `Transaction` class represents an individual financial transaction, with attributes such as description, amount, and a boolean indicating whether it's an income transaction or an expense. It also includes methods to retrieve transaction details.The `BudgetTracker` class manages a collection of transactions, allowing users to add transactions, calculate total income and expenses, display a budget summary, and provide budget suggestions. The class includes methods like `addTransaction`, `calculateTotalIncome`, `calculateTotalExpenses`, `displaySummary`, `checkForAlert`, and `provideSuggestions`.In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to input transaction details in a loop, creating instances of the `Transaction` class and adding them to the `BudgetTracker`. The user can continue adding transactions until choosing to exit. Afterward, the program displays a summary of total income, expenses, and balance. It also provides suggestions based on the overall financial balance, encouraging savings or expense reduction.It's a basic budget tracking application that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in C++. Users can use this program to keep track of their financial transactions and get suggestions based on their budget balance.
